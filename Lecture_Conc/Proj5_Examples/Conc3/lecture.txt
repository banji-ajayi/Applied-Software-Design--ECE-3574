Shared memory is such that two processes can acccess each others memory and make changes to it.  A simple exaple could be to know when Process A is finished, it could write a 1 to memory and process B could read
that sector to see what value it is and then perform an action.

Note that processes can not access spaces of memory it isn't authorized to unless the OS alllows it.

How to communicate with other processes? Welll process should go to OS and tell it to give it a piece of memory that can be shared with other authorized processes. The OS will not raise  any red flags for such attempts at a later point in time. 

Now we have message passing. Want to put a message somewhere.And if you want to communicate , then you have to wait in the message queue and pull messages from there. The OS typically handles this and is in the example of a Mailbox. 

Shared memory is much faster than message processing.
