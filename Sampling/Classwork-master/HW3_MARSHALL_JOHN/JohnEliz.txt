So I switched to this because I can type faster than I can text, so yeah. And yes I do wear special shoes when I dance. I wear ballet flats for ballet, and then I have special shoes called pointe shoes for if I want to go up on my toes, but I don't wear them anymore because my ankles can't handle pointe shoes anymore. The pointe shoes add too much stress to my ankles, that I am actually in pain, so I just stick to my ballet flats. I have tap shoes for when I do tap, and tan jazz shoes for when I do jazz, and I just wear my sneakers for hip-hop. hahha a lot of shoes to add to my collection!
Whoa. That's awesome  I imagine they must get smelly with all the dancing you do haha. 😎 not that that's at all a bad thing. Btw I'm about to take a flight so I won't be able to talk for a few hours. Sorry! Talk to you a bit later(: and I hope the movie was good for
Good**

ok! HAVE A SAFE FLIGHT!!!!!  Talk to you later!!!
Thanks! And hey reply to that message xD haha.

hahah why do you want me to admit that my feet smell? 

Because they do after I dance.......in case of you were wondering
Lol! Of course. I expect nothing but the full truth xD how bad are they haha. Oh and the movie too

Bad enough that my friend's mom would make me and my friend spray our feet with body spray from bath and body works....hahah it was that bad! And the movie was soooo goood!!!!! I want her ballgown!!! It was absolutely stunning!!!

Happy now? 
😮 whoa. They must reek xD but that's a good thing, it means you're passionate about what you do. I feel really bad for your shoes though 😛 although I don't believe you I don't think they could get that bad haha. And that's awesome. Is it a movie you'd recommend someone like me to go watch?(: it sounds like it could be a very girly movie
And very happy 

Ohhh trust me my shoes are loved! And thanks! But trust me they can get that bad, but not anymore because I don't dance as often as I used to. I mean, Cinderella is basically like any disney princess movie you have seen. I mean I don't know what type of movies you like, but it is a well done movie, so yeah I do recommend it to you. I mean there were I lot of dads with their daughters if that means anything to you.  But yeah there were mostly girls there, but a real man would see this movie! 

And I am glad that your happy!

March 15th, 9:21pm
Your shoes are loved?! Lol I don't believe a princesses feet could ever get stinky 😛 and well I guess I'll have to see it then, I just hope it doesn't make me sleep (; jk. I'm into action, horror and comedy

Yeah my shoes are loved; I wear them and break them in and make them look worn. haha well I'll let you be the judge of that.  And yes you should see Cinderella with your friends...it would be a good bonding experience!! You better not fall asleep because that would be embarrassing.  So you like action, horror, and comedies, so what are some examples of movies you like to watch?
I like redbox horror movies, umm I saw American sniper and I loved the Star Trek ones 😛 and you'll let me be the judge? Lol I still don't believe you. Are you gonna show me how worn your shoes can get?  XD and i would see that with my friends but I doubt I could convince any of them to go lol

I want to see American Sniper; that's on my "to watch" list. I haven't seen any of the Star Trek movies, and the only horror movies I have seen were Insidious Chapters 1 and 2 and I had my hands over my eyes half the time. What are redbox horror movies? And yeah I'll let you be the judge of whether princesses' feet smell..I mean it's a possibility because every princess has her flaws. I mean if you want to see my shoes I will show you, but I left them at school. This week is my spring break, so when I get back remind me if you are still interested in what my shoes look like hahah. OMG im sure you can convince one of your friends to see it haha.

Let me tell you, one of my guy friends saw frozen three times before I saw it once. I know frozen is different from cinderella.
March 16th, 3:37am
i have zero interest in seeing frozen; just the previews bore me. And Redbox horror movies are pretty much like insidious xD sorta scary/jumpy. I probably could trick my friends into seeing it, like "yo guys lets watch a movie, you guys get the popcorn and i'll but tickets" lol (; oh and im definitely interested in seeing just how bad this princess thinks she can make her feet lol xD bring it on! im man enough to handle a little bit of smell haha. and yes pictures can also be handled, i can take it  i bet they aernt even that bad haha
oh and sorry for the late reply, just got back to my college apartment
March 16th, 10:17am

No worries!  But wow you got back pretty late!!!! 

And your loss then because it's a pretty good movie, but I wouldn't want to torture you with it. hehehe anyway I don' think I could handle redbox horror movies then; I don't feel like being scared to death. 

hehe good plan to trick your friends......not at all sketchy!   I hope it works!!

Well, I hate to break it to you but you probably won't be able to smell her feet. I'm sorry to disappoint you; I hope that wasn't your main reason to see this movie? 

And as for my shoes, it all depends on which ones I show you; my newish ones or my oldish ones.   

So tell me something about you. So you said you can fly, so I am assuming you mean that you can fly airplanes, right?
This is such a fun conversation(: highlight of my day talking to you haha. 

So I mean we could make a compromise here, I torture you with a horror movie and you torture me with frozen xD you can be there to make sure I pay attention and I'd be there to stop you from having your eyes closed hahaha. 

And when I said princess I meant you silly, I'm sure the movie princess has perfect feet, like you 😛 and ig show me your worst ones, you're trying to prove a point right?

And yup!! I haven't flown in a while though, it's a bit expensive but when I can I'll go with my friends and we will rent a small plane and go somewhere like block island 

AWwwwwww STOP IT!!!!! you're just saying that!!! I enjoy talking to you too!!! I look forward to it!!!  
 
Deal!!!! I bet I can make you like Frozen!!!! And don't worry I will make sure you are paying attention!!! I will poke you if you are not! heheh But I will only torture you with it once. With my brothers I have tortured them at least 5 times with it, but they like it though, so I guess it's not really torture. Trust me, you probably won't be paying any attention to the horror movie...you will be laughing at me the whole time! MY friends make fun of me if we watch a scary movie; it would be like watching a horror movie and a comedy show at the same time! hahah  

Ohhh my bad!!! hahhaha im sorry!!! Just to let you know, my feet don't normally smell...only after my dance lessons. And did you purposely say "to prove a 'point'"??? hahahha xD

OMG THAT IS SOOO COOL!!!!!! I can imagine that it costs a lot!! What made you want to learn? I haven't been on an airplane in over 10 years, so I don't really remember what it's like to be on an airplane.
hey!!! I am totally not just saying that. I am a no bullshit kinda guy. 

what you said about the horror movie is probably true xD the only downside to the movie stuff is that now that im in virginia we cant really watch these movies in each others company :< but if frozen is out on dvd i could pick it up and tell you what I think. I wouldnt expect you to do the same with a horror movie cause i mean ya know.. you'd be alone when you watched it >:P plus I wouldnt get to laugh at you like you said  i mean uhhhh laugh with you!! 

And I'm sureeeee they dont ever smell xD lol. but I bet that means your dance shoes have seen better days  i wanna be the judge of that though! and I did say to prove a point haha. you're very pretty so its hard for me to believe you can wear out a pair of shoes that are meant for dancing  

and thanks a bunch  it is a lot of fun, and you can see some pretty cool sights. Whenever I go with them too, I always make my friends fly because theres two sets of controls haha. and it is a bit costly, but definitely worth it if you're taking someone whose never seen it before. Umm my family has a few pilots in it and I think they just want to keep tradition going; so one summer they sponsored me to get my license and basically i flew for the entire summer and was able to get my license  and why so long? don't you like to travel?:)

OK OK OK OK!!! I'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry!!! I believe you!!! I pinkie swear I do!!! 

Yeah it's unfortunate that we can't watch them together.....  And yeah Frozen is on DVD!! You better watch for real!!!!! I don't want you to just google the summary of it! I expect a full report!! I would watch the horror movie, just not by myself in the dark when all the monsters come out. I would make one of my friends watch it with me and we can scream together! Just tell me know which horror movie. And hahahahha you think you're sooo funny. 

heheh you're too kind!!!  hhaha I'll let you judge my shoes and my feet all you want....I can take it because I have heard it all! heheh I have never met someone who is sooo into my dance shoes and my feet!! And thanks for the compliment!!!  You know how to make a girl blush!!! But like I said, i'll show you my dance shoes when i get back to school next week! And you best believe me!!!! 

YOU'RE WELCOME A BUNCH!!!!!!   The view must be beautiful from up there especially on a clear sunny day!!!! I love staring at gorgeous views! OH MY GOODNESS YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS TO FLY?!?!? you're nuts! If I ever get on a plane with you, don't ever put me in control....it will be a mistake! But yeah it must be worth it...IT SOUNDS INCREDIBLE!!!!!!! WOW you have a lot of pilots in your family...THAT'S AWESOME!!!! That's a cool tradition!!! And yeah I love to travel, but I have a huge family, so it can be really expensive. We have a 12 seater van that we drive when we go on vacations.
March 16th, 1:42pm
I think we have slight trust issues with each other haha. 

If you'd like I can go grab frozen and watch it and give you a full report 😛 we could talk about it after. But it's gonna be a one shot deal so don't be expecting me to watch it 5 times with you this summer xD and I think I'll be nice the first time around and just ask you to see a good action movie in return; oh! Or Star Trek!! Wanna do that?!(: 

And I just want to prove to you that what most would say is the worst part of someone really isn't all that bad  jk. I definitely wasn't thinking that when your feet got pulled into this conversation haha. Are you sure I can judge your shoes and feet all I want?! I'll try to go easy on ya. But ya definitely send me pictures when you're back in school 😛 or if you'd like to start early send me a picture of your foot now lmao although I'm not sure what I'd say about it  lol!

The view is amazing from up above! And you can do a bunch of cool stuff like see your house etc. also, do you like roller coasters? If you push forward harshly on the yolk (the steering wheel) then the plane goes down really fast and you have the falling sensation  letting someone else fly the plane really isn't as dangerous as it sounds, in fact most of the time I fly I don't have my hands on the controls; once the plane is properly "trimmed" it just flies straight and level in one direction. But if I pass it to you like that, then you can just make small changes with the yolk and you've got control of where we go  so ya if we ever fly you are definitely getting control haha. 

Tell me more about your travels, a family of twelve?!??!!??? You must be driven crazy T.T what does a 12 seater van even look like and where do you go??? 
March 16th, 4:51pm

heheh yes we need to work on trusting in one another. I'll try. 

YES I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT!!!!! AND YESS YOU SHOULD GET FROZEN!!!!!! I want to hear what you think of it!!!! It is slightly different from the other disney princess movies. And don't worry, I won't make you watch it 5 times....the most I would make you watch it is twice. Once by yourself and once with me.  It will be a totally different experience if you watch it with me. And thank you for being nice. Yeah I will watch Star Trek!!! I think I have one of the movies at my house, but aren't there multiple? I don't know, but yeah I will let you know which one I have. Otherwise, I will just watch it from a sketchy website. hehehe 

Oh trust me my feet are not the worst part about me...at least I don't think they are. I don't really know what my worst quality is...I don't really think about it. heheh I know you weren't thinking about my feet then....but now you are!!! hehehe   Cuz now you want pictures of my feet?? Just so you know I am not taking pictures of my feet and sharing them with you cuz that's just weird. Mainly because last weekend I went ice skating and got some nasty blisters on my feet, which are still healing. My feet are not a sight to see now or ever! 

Just so you know, I HATE ROLLER COASTERS!!!! Heights don't scare me, but I have a huge fear of falling. That feeling of falling scares the crap out of me. So if I am ever on the plane, DON'T PUSH FORWARD HARSHLY ON THE YOLK!!!!! I will be sooooooo mad at you and I will scream and you will be sorry you did that! 

ok flying a plane doesn't sound too bad, just don't scare me, I beg you!!! 

No no no! I have a family of 7! God if there were 12 people in my family, I would go beyond crazy!!! I have 3 older brothers and a younger sister, and of course my mom and my dad. We mostly go to New Hampshire, Vermont, and upstate New York in the Adirondacks. My parents love mountains so we tend to go to places with mountains. We have been to gettysburg and Washington D.C., and 10 years ago we went out west and saw a whole bunch of national parks like the grand canyon, zion, and stuff like that. 

Do you have any siblings?

Sorry these messages take me soooo long to write!

I feel like I am writing a novel hahhah 

This is the van. Sorry I couldn't take a better photo of it because it was in the Garage. But yeah its nickname is the "Alberg Mobile" hehe
I just watched frozen silly but you already knew that  and I could definitely watch it again, it wasn't as corny as I originally thought it would be lol. Why will it be a different experience if I watch it with you?? And there is more than one star trek, you should probably start with the 2009 movie, Star Trek haha. Let me know which one you have though. 

And whoa! the foot conversation has ignited some kind of fury in you I see xD I think after each message your feet become more and more worse off lmao. Now I'm super curious to see how bad they really are but I don't wanna seem like a weirdo :< you're already gonna send me pictures of your worn out shoes haha. But you did send me pictures of your van and thats kinda weird so maybe you will? XD 

Hmm. I think roller coasters is something else we will need to try. Honestly there isn't a close enough amusement park to Rhode Island so I think a lot of people that live there have this bad fear of coasters. If we go flying I can't make any promises I won't make you feel the dropping sensation  

7 people is still a large family! Do you do a lot of hiking when you go on vacations? I feel like your family would love Virginia haha theres a lot of mountains here. What else do you do in the other places you visit?

I have one younger sister and my parents are divorced but that happened a long time ago so everything is good now 
and creating this novel is kinda fun lmao

YAY FROZEN!!!!!!  I am glad that it wasn't that torturous...at least I hope it wasn't. hahha It will be different because I will be there!!!!  If you watch it with me, I will tell you about all the parts that I think are funny and then you will laugh with me. And sometimes I sing along, although you might find that annoying..... and we can make fun of the characters together!!!  And yes I do have the Star Trek movie from 2009, so I will probably watch that either tonight or tomorrow. 

hahha OMG now I am becoming more self-conscious about my feet!!!! heheh I am only kidding!  I am proud of my feet no matter what they look like! You thinks it's weird that I sent you pictures of my van? I thought you wanted to see what the van looked like? OMG I don't want to send you anymore weird things!!! I don't want you to know how weird I am!!! Actually you should know by now that I am a little weird...im ok now...sorry for the nervous break down....pheeewwww. hahaah I just think it's funny how we are still talking about my feet...I had no idea they were sooo interesting. hahaha

HELL TO THE MOTHER FUCKING NO ( excuse me for the swears) AM I GOING ON A ROLLER COASTER!!!! I WILL LITERALLY CRY MY EYES OUT!!! I AM SERIOUS ABOUT THAT!!!! I have been on a roller coaster before and I hated it, and had anxiety the whole time....PLEASE DON'T DO THAT TO ME!!!!! Please don't make the dropping sensation, but if you do I will scream in your ear, and there is a possibility that you might become deaf from that. 

YEah sometimes we go on trails and we drive to the top of certain mountains. Sometimes we do these adventure courses that are in the trees. It is basically these obstacles that are in the trees and each course gets harder and harder. And the harder the course the higher up you are in the trees. And we mainly go sight seeing or sometimes kayaking if there is a river we can go on. In gettysburg we visit the battlefield and we go to other battlefields that were fought on during the civil war. I think my family did go to Virginia once, but I was like 8 years old, so I don't remember it too much. 

What kind of places to you go to with your family? 

And you have a younger sister?!?!?  AWWWWWWWW Are you close with her? and that's good that everything is good now with your parents.  

And yeah I love writing this novel with you!!!  The story of our lives!
no but this really is the story of our lives! xD it is indeed interesting. 

I would be excited to watch Frozen with a disney movie pro like yourself  although to be completely honest I thought all the singing was super annoying xD let me know when you decide to watch the star trek movie and also what you think of it 
oh still in the middle of replying here, hold on
and you shouldnt feel self concious around me! lol especially not about your feet, omg  lol. We are both weird people, this should be self evident from our conversation we are having now haha. Your feet are super interesting!! in a way, they are like the key to your hobby, dancing  and tbh I've never actually seen what a real dancers feet look like haha. We have a lot of firsts in our future dont we? lol! 

andddd speaking of firsts, you need to hop on a roller coaster and enjoy the heck out of it! I swear its fun! but I dont want you to be nervous around me so I promise i wont do anything scary with you if you climb into a place with me 
Plus, i wouldnt want to go dea
deaf*
Your vacations sound like fun, so in the tree courses, you're not afraid of the heights? do they ever have ziplines? those are fun. My family and I did something similar to that in oregon and it was a blast  and gettysburg also sounds great, never done that before but it must be soooo cool seeing an old battlefield and being at a historic landmark such as that. 

me and my younger sis aernt super close but kinda close, my family is weird, like me xD its just something you gotta kinda figure out slowly as time goes on lol
ok your turn!!
March 16th, 7:46pm

I did read this, but I will respond later when I have more time! Sorry about that!
Alright no worries haha I don't mind

I love the story you are telling me!!!  

YAY!!!  I promise not to sing though...I wouldn't want to annoy you!  ANd yeah of course I will let you know when I watch Star Trek!!! I mean it's not like it was my plan to watch it and not tell you pshhhh.  

Ok... I will try not to feel self conscious hahaha. And same for you!!! Don't ever be afraid to be weird around me... I LIKE WEIRD!!!!  I will be nothing but my crazy, loud, enthusiastic, excited self. Although I consider myself as a introvert...more like an outgoing introvert. Do you consider yourself an introvert or an extrovert?

 And I was just kidding about the nervous break down, I wasn't really having one. HAHahh yeah we are weird in a good way...I mean I don't think normal people talk about feet this much haahha. Then again what is normal? I have been asking myself that question my whole life!

 hahahaah you make me smile way too much when I read your message!  I just wanted to let you know that!!!

ummmmm are you sure you want to see what  a dancer's foot looks like? They are pretty disgusting. Mine aren't that disgusting anymore since i have cut back on dance and don't wear my pointe shoes anymore. 

And yes we do have a lot of firsts, which I am excited to hopefully do with you!!!!  

Oh God, I don't know...we'll see. I will think about going on a roller coaster with you, but I Guarantee you that I won't. I'm too chicken when it comes to roller coasters. So you have any fears?

Oh shit I wasn't done!!! Don't respond yet!!

haha thanks! Im not afraid of heights...i am just afraid of falling. Or the feeling of falling. The tree courses do have zip lines, which are really fun. I can do zip-lines, they are not that bad! WOW you've been to Oregon? That's cool! Where in Oregon did you go to? You should definitely go to Gettysburg someday....it is absolutely stunning!!!!! And also very cool to see and learn about the battle of course!  

Every family is a little weird....and that is completely normal! haha xD You make it sound as if your family is complicated. Are you and your sister close in age? 

My family ok. The weird thing about my family is that we actually all get along...we can get mad and angry at one another, but we never really fight with one another or hold grudges. I am close with all my siblings, but I would say that I am closest with my brother Matt, who if you ever look at the pictures of me with my siblings, he is the one with brown hair and brown eyes and is super skinny. The rest of my siblings have blue eyes. so yeah that's my family.
ahh. lets see, where to start?  hmm i wouldnt call it a story, that implies that it could be fictional  

and you could sing! you sing and dance so if you sang while we watched Frozen together I wouldn't be annoyed, I would enjoy hearing your voice when you sing  

I will always be weird around you, and never self concious  haha! expect nothing but the same weirdness you dish out in return from me  but hey, thats what help makes it all fun and memorable. I am probably more of an introvert, but I force myself to be social all the time xD I have a very very close circle of friends (kind of a large circle actually) but close, and we all chill together and talk all the time  but since im in two places for most of the year, I have like RI friends and VA friend circles haha. 

Normal people most definitely do not talk about feet this much, but hey you can learn something new everyday and that doesnt happen by being normal and boring xD normal would be like me asking you about the weather, saying whats up, and being formal and boring  i guess thats just my opinion though; sometimes normal can be good. 

I hope my messages always bring a smile to your face, yours make me smile and at some parts laugh  

oh! and I am very sure I want to see what a dancers foot looks like, come on, the curiosity is killing me!! lol xD is that the reason you cut back on dancing is because of how it was affecting your feet? 

Back to the rollercoaster part, so like if we go to an amusement park, I wouldnt be like "hey liz lets go on the scariest one!" id take you on progressively harder and more fun rollercoasters so you could enjoy yourself and see that they are more fun than scary  and yes, i'd let you hold my hand but only at certain parts (; 

I have a slight fear of heights, and a fear of throwing up. So whenever I drink which is rare im very careful because my phobia is of puking, another wierd thing about me right?!

I've been to Oregon a few times actually, once for my pilots license all summer and a couple times after just for fun 

What happened at gettysburg? can you tell me about the battle? im definitely interested in learning more about it  

my family is super complicated!! I can't even begin to tell you  my sister is 17, she will be 18 in may and I'm 21, so kinda close.  Letting the little things go is something my family is bad at, like big things they work through it but small stuff will be on their minds all day. And oh good to know  why are you and him particularly close? Your eyes are brown too right?

We can call it a journal, since it is like a journey through our lives.  

I am sorry I was dozing off. hahaha that was all I wrote.

Hold on don't respond I pushed enter by mistake again!

Awww thanks John!!!  Your the best!!! To be quite honest, I consider myself more of a singer than a dancer. I enjoy singing more than I do dancing and personally I think I am a better singer than I am a dancer. Musical talent runs in my family. Either we sing or play an instrument or both. I just sing, just so we are clear. 

OMG!!! I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET YOU IN PERSON!!!!!!! You are already memorable to me and we have not even met in person yet!  

Sorry I am like all over the place, but I just want to say i like read your messages like 5 times before I start responding, and even as I am writing I Stop to read again because I smile more and more the more times I read it. Some of the things you say are beautiful and I sincerely mean that!   And then I realize I have written only a couple of small paragraphs and it has been like 10 minutes! 

hahah you force yourself to be social? I hope you are not forcing yourself to be social with me!  That's nice that you have two close group of friends. I would say I am mostly close with my college friends, but I am in touch with a few of my high school friends. I have a lot of friends, but in all honesty I am only close to two of them. And those two friends I consider my best friends and I tell them everything and anything. I don't really like opening up to a lot of people, I mean my other friends know a lot about me, but they don't know the really deep stuff about me. It's hard for me to open up sometimes and I can't really explain why it just is. 

I agree normal can be boring and sometimes you get no where in life by being normal. hahahah I can never look at my feet the same way again because of this!!  Every time I look at my feet I think about how much you really want to see them!!! HAHAHAHAHHA I am sorry, but I still won't send you pictures of my feet!  

heheh I am glad that you laugh and smile when you read this!!!  It brings me great joy knowing that!!! 

My senior year of high school my dance teacher closed her studio and so I kind of lost touch with dancing. And when I went to college, I just don't have time to take all the classes I want to. It was the pointe shoes that mostly affected my feet and ankles and I just had to stop doing ballet on my pointe shoes, which made me sad, but oh well.

Ummmm if we go to an amusement park, you will be luck if I go on one or two roller coasters! MY brother Matt once spent like a half an hour trying to convince me to go on a roller coaster, but I wouldn't. I will probably never go on the scariest roller coaster....I just couldn't. I would feel bad though because I wouldn't want to spoil the fun.....so hint hint don't take me to an amusement park. I will go on a hike with you instead!!!!  

hahah I don't think it is weird that you are afraid of throwing up, because throwing up is awful. I don't blame you for not drinking that much. I honestly don't remember what it is like to throw up because I haven't thrown up since like the 2nd grade. Not that you needed to know that. by the way fun fact I LOVE TMI!!!! Any ways yeah I don't really drink that much either. I honestly didn't start to drink until this semester, I just drink enough to get a little tipsy, but I don't even do it that often. I think it is weird that you are scared of heights since you can fly airplanes...I find that interesting. but I applaud you for facing your fear...you are brave!!!!  Sometimes fear comes with the things you love or love to do. 


 I will tell you more about gettysburg when I am more awake, but I honestly don't remember much except the north won and it was the turning part in the civil war. 

I wish I could understand what you mean with your family but I don't, but you don't have to explain. Me and my brother MAtt just have this special connection that I can't explain and I look up to him. Out of all my siblings, I talk about him most. And yes my eyes are Brown! 

Sorry I like dozed off a couple more times writing this hahaah

Why do you have to go to Oregon for your pilot licence?
Tuesday 12:31am
So it will likely be morning once you read this, good morning!! 

if only you could see my face, you're making me blush! haha. When we do meet in person, I hope we are in a place where I can see you sing and dance, that would be amazing. I know you say you're better at singing than at dancing, but I'm sure you could amaze a lot of people with either skill. I play a little bit of piano, a lot of the songs I know are from our generation, maybe we could also do some form of duet? that would be a lot of fun. I'm a sucker for taylor swift, shes my favorite artist. I dont tell a lot of people that though :$ I hope we can open up to each other because I really wanna know all there is to know about you  

I like to read your messages a few times over as well, what I do is I reply in one tab and have another tab along side it with what you wrote and respond to each paragraph  

oh so when I said I forced myself to be social, what I mean is that I kind of have some social anxiety and im a real lightweight so in social situations I can be a little bit awkward, and one beer is enough to get me a little buzzed so being a college student, I'm not exactly your ideal frat boy so when people invite me to hangout or to parties I get slightly anxious  again not something I tell really anybody. Boy this is turning out to be a revealing message :$ I know you said you dont like openning up to a lot of people, but me and you seem to click pretty well so far, I hope you are comfortable revealing yourself to me as well  If not though, I understand as it is a bit soon and I tend to blunder right into things. I'm really good at being blunt, facing my fears, and doing what needs to be done, I think I picked part of that up from college. 

And oh gosh  I hope you dont think I'm weird for asking for pictures of your feet! pictures of your shoes next week is probably weird enough! haha. It is a funny topic though and I laugh whenever I come across this part  actually a little embarassment is good for us so I dont mind it. Tell me again how smelly your feet get after dancing? xD JK! 

Sorry to hear you lost touch with dancing, thats a real bummer. Is it like one of those skills that you never forget (IE riding a bike)? I bet the pointe shoes were rough on you, I tried to stand on my tip toes earlier and it was painful so I can only imagine what you mustve went through dancing on them O.O 

If we go to an amusement park I will most certainly convince you to go on some rollercoasters  Let me get this straight, you would trust me with your life by climbing into an airplane with me, but you wouldnt go on a small rollercoaster with me..?  A hike sounds like a good alternative, but I'm the type of person who says, why not both?? 

At this point thanks for not thinking I'm a complete weirdo  a pilot whose afraid of heights and puking who asks about your feet? xD doesnt get much more specific than that. But really, you hardly notice heights in a plane its weird. Facing that fear really wasn't at ALL difficult for me. Puking still is a challenge, but like you said its not often you puke. 

TMI is your friend in this conversation! lol. It sounds like you party very responsibly which is a good thing, me and you would be two peas in a pod at a party. 

Aside from rollercoasters, do you have anymore fears? Maybe we can encourage each other to face them. For example, if we go to an amusement park you can take me on a ride that goes really high and I'll take you on a rollercoaster  or do both at the same time?  

Definitely tell me more about the gettysburg address when it comes to mind and thanks for letting me off the hook with explaining my family; its a tough thing to do haha. Also, its important to have someone to look up to and I'm glad its your brother, since you two are close its indeed a good thing  

Talk to you more lateron! Tuesdays and thursdays are my busiest days at college so if I take a while to respond I'm very sorry my Queen Elizabeth!
oh oops I missed a message! I was just rereading what your wrote :$ haha. I went to Oregon for my pilots license because they are very aviation friendly on the west coast where its bigger. Think about all the major airports on the East coast, whereas on the west coast its like a lot more open space which is very necessary for when you are doing cross countries which is where you fly 50-300 miles solo and navigate to airports you've never seen before. When you land you call up your instructor from a phone there to prove you did it then you fly back its a lot of fun 
Tuesday 9:45am

Awwww JOHN!!!! This was the first thing I read this morning (besides your text)...what a great way to start my day! I will respond to everything later, but I just wanted to read what you had to say! And no worries, there is never any rush to respond!  I don't want to distract you too much from your studies!
I'm glad I could help you get your day off to a good start  and awh don't worry about that! I have my priorities straight and plus you're the best distraction! Lol 
Tuesday 4:47pm

 I wish I could see your reaction, but I guess I will only imagine it. Oh man I am going to have to sing and dance for you? I am going to have to put on a show for you! I better start preparing now!  And I would LOVE to hear you play the piano and I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to do a duet with you!!! That would be soooo cute!!!!!  Oooooooo Taylor Swift, I will keep that in mind! And your secret is safe with me!  

I hope we can open up to each other too!!!! When I do open up to people, I slowly tell them more and more about me. But with you for some reason I am able to disclose so much about myself so quickly.  I guess I am just not afraid to tell you anything. And hope you feel or will feel the same way!  

I like the way you think with having two tabs open....GENIUS!!!!! 

To be quite honest I never really cared for typical frat boys; I never really found them appealing. I am sure you are not that awkward, I can't tell at least!  But I understand you with the social anxiety. If you were to ask my friends, they would say I am one of the most outgoing person they know, but that is only because I am comfortable around them and they know who I am. When I am around people I don't know, I am soo shy and I don't really want to talk to anyone. When I go to parties, I don't really socialize with anyone other than my friends. I mostly just hang with my roommate (who is one of my best friends) and we just dance the night away together and we actually hope that no one comes over to socialize with us. I would just get sooo nervous if someone came over to talk to me and I wouldn't know how to talk to them. Although my other friends are social butterflies and talk to a lot of people at the parties. 

Well I mean I do think you are weird, but I love that about you!!!!  Don't change that!!! heheh I mean like I keep saying you are the only person I know who wants to see what my feet look like! hehheheh and you are the only guy I know who wants to see pictures of my shoes!!! You keep on surprising me!!! I love it!!  Well I didn't think this was a funny topic until I met you. haha And by the way, my feet smell like roses, thank you for asking.  

YEah dancing is one of those things that I will never forget, since I have been doing it since I was three. But my technique is not that great anymore, but whatever it happens. heheh silly you can't stand on your tip toes unless if you wear the proper shoes. The pointe shoes have wood in them to help form your arches and to help support you while on your toes. But yeah they were painful sometimes. 

Yes I would trust you with my life if I went into an airplane with you. I trust you more than I trust a metal or wooden roller coaster. And because I am afraid of disappointing you, I will go on one roller with you, but I can't promise that I will like it!!! And well I am just saying if we only have time for one of them, I would prefer the hiking, then again maybe I should be careful what I ask for.  

Awwww John!!!!! I don't think you are a weirdo (maybe weird but everyone is a little weird). By what you write I can tell that you are a man with a big heart; your life is full of adventure whether you are high in the sky flying an airplane, or on the ground exploring a trail, or just chilling with your friends! You are not a weirdo, you are more than that! 

WOW I still can't believe you don't notice the height when you are up in the airplane! Did it take you a while to overcome that fear while on the plane or did you instantly overcome it? 

And yes we would be best buds at a party! Although I would make you dance with me! I don't go to parties to socialize....I go to dance (surprise surprise). I am telling you soon you will realize how predictable I am!  

Ohh yeah I have plenty of fears. I have a fear of disappointing people. This is kind of bad because then I feel like I need to please everyone, but in reality I don't; I just need to please those who matter to me. I also have a fear of swallowing pills, which is kind of funny because I am studying to become a pharmacist someday. If the pill is to big, I have to cut it in half and sometimes even in fourths. I am such a baby when it comes to pills. hahahha And I have plenty of more fears, but none of them are coming to my mind right now. 

Yes I would like that! We can work together to overcome our fears!  However, I am not going to help you overcome your puking fear....you're on your own for that. But if you did throw-up I would be there for you bud!! I would make sure that you are ok.  hahah you really want to take me to an amusement park, huh? We'll see. I already told you I will go on A roller coaster with you, so maybe I will make you go on a ride goes really high, or maybe I will think of something else, like go on a skyscraper with a glass floor or something...I don't know I'll figure it out! 

Ok so I am not a history buff, and I can't remember a lot of the details about the Battle of Gettysburg, but what I do remember is that for the first half of the Civil War, the South was winning and basically dominating. The Battle of Gettysburg was not a planned battle; it kind of just happened. It started on July 1st, 1863 and lasted until July 3rd 1963. The North had the higher ground (which was little round top which is a hill) and it's hard to defeat an opponent with the higher ground, but the south fought hard. Thousands of soldiers died that day. The worst part was that generals on both sides were actually friends, so it was like battling your friend, so it was also a very emotional battle. I don't remember much more, but the North won and from then on the North basically won the rest of the battles and eventually the war! 

Wow! That sounds like an awesome experience in Oregon! And true, true, out west is a lot more open. Have you ever flown 300 miles? That seems like a long way and exhausting too! Wait were you by yourself on the airplane because you said you called your instructor once you landed at the designated spot?

I hope you had a WONDERFUL TUESDAY Sir John!!!!!! 

I forgot to ask but what is your favorite Taylor Swift song?

I didn't proof read so I hope there are no errors
Tuesday 8:27pm
wow that was an amazing message :'D I'm really excited to see where our friendship takes us!

once we are together you will get to see my reactions to what you say  or we could call each other sometime! and yes, you will certainly have to sing and dance for me but in return I will do whatever you'd like to see from me  a duet sounds fun and cute  if you go through my facebook archives maybe you could find some highly embarassing posts of me playing haha I definitely dont encourage you to do that though :$ infact I forget I said anything about that!! I'm glad my secrets are safe with you (phew) 

I love learning more about you Liz, as time goes on I know we will figure more and more out about each other, I hope you still like me by the time you learn all my embarassing and weird secrets, maybe the good ones will help offset any of the bad  theres very very few things Im afraid to tell you about me :$ it doesn't apply to us being just friends though, so I guess it would only come out if we are both interested in being more than friends if you catch my drift? I'm glad though that you feel so comfortable telling me more about you  

The two tabs to reply to your messages idea comes from doing programming. Sometimes when I program I'll use one tab to see the problem im trying to solve, and the other to program in  not that talking to you is any time of a problem O.O haha quite the opposite 

It sounds like we are both pretty similar in terms of how social we are(:  if we were to meet up would you be comfortable and social around me? I've gotten over my social anxiety a little by going to career events where you are forced to speak to people you've never met, tell them about yourself and possibly interview with them lateron.

lol I'm soooo glad you dont think I'm weird  and I guess the fact that I want to see your feet and shoes makes me unique huh? xD THERE IS NO WAY YOUR FEET SMELL LIKE ROSES. you're joking when you said that right? I tend to be a very literal person haha so i might take your sarcasm the wrong way, especially if I can only read it   when you mentioned the pointe shoes the only thing that comes to my mind is pain O.O those things sound terrible. But hey at least they got what they deserved xD they had to put up with your feet all the time lol!

I would trust you with my life too in an airplane, or a car  I bet you are extremely dependable and its going to be fun building up trust with you as life goes on. What you said about trusting me more than a rollercoaster makes sense, I can understand your viewpoint more now  and yes, if we could choose amusement park or hiking, I would definitely take you hiking. When we hangout I wouldn't ever want to leave you with memories that could be bad and hiking would be a nice way to fill a day with happy memories. 

 And thanks so much for the compliments! you're so kind to me Liz and I love that you can so easily see the good in people. Honestly, I think you have a bigger heart than me and if there is any non-literal way to measure that then the challenge will be on! 

When I was getting lessons my instructor and I were doing stalls one day. A stall is when a planes wings lose lift and it can happen for a couple of different reasons, but you practice them to become natural at recovering for those situations. Anyways, during one of the times I stalled the plane, one of the wings stalled before the other wing did meaning that one side of the plane was producing lift and the other side wasnt. So the plane went into something called a spin where it noses down and spirals towards the ground; these are hard to recover from because you need to go against your natural reactions to just pull up, you need to push down. This was the moment I overcame my fear of heights in planes, my instructor refused to take over and as we spiraled down towards the ground my heart was beating out of my chest. Just picture, the only thing I could see in front of me was the ground. Initially I tried pulling up but of course that didn't work for me at all, and as we got closer I snapped out of it and did the right thing and finally recovered, it wasn't at all a close call or anything and I'm sure if I failed my instructor wouldve taken over, but for me it was a big moment, heights in planes no longer bothered me after. 

For the record, I WOULD LOVE TO DANCE WITH YOU. I wouldn't be any good :$ but I think it would be so so sooo fun to do. What music would we dance to? 

I think we could definitely help each other overcome more of our fears  I hope you believe me, but I actually have a LOT of trouble swallowing pills too!! no matter how tiny they are, I just cant do it. I never really thought of it as a fear though, more of just a skill I don't have. When I need to, I crush them and drink them even if it tastes really bad. Hmm I'm not sure yet how we can work on your fear of disappointing people. Could you give me some examples of times this has haunted you? Like would you ever lie about something to avoid disappointing someone (like lie about how you feel or something)? 

I would definitely think that as someone who wants to be a pharmacist you would need to overcome your fear of swallowing pills, I mean at least with me I dont need to overcome that one but for you its a different story!:P And no worries, I definitely wouldnt expect you to help me with my fear of puking haha! 

Thanks for being brave enough to actually agreeing to go on a rollercoaster with me, thats very courageous of you haha, especially if you are leaving me to choose whichever one I want. 

The Gettysburg stuff sounds very interesting. It must've really been rough for the two friends, having to send men to battle to kill each other and being on opposite sides in their own country, on their own land. 

Everywhere you go theres a new adventure waiting to happen, of course some of them can be bad experiences but for the most part they are all good. So technically I have flown 300 miles, but it wasn't like I went 300 miles away and then back, the pattern I did was more like a equilateral triangle where each side was a distance of say 100 miles. Talk about an easy flight though, I got to plan it all out the day before on paper, I had a GPS for backup, and used radio-navigation which sounds fancy but is very easy. Plus if you think about it, once I got going, since I was able to plan it out I only needed to fly one heading, and I already knew about how long I needed to fly that heading for and so it was more of me just pointing the plane in one direction and waiting lol and yes it was all by my bored self.  I'm sorry if I'm talking your ear off about flying! Whats the biggest adventure you've ever been on?

Tuesday seems to be almost over and so I hope your had an amazing day Queen Elizabeth! May I call you Beth for short instead of Liz, or would you prefer Liz? let me know! Oh and also, what did you end up doing today? I hope whatever it was, you enjoyed it!

My favorite T-Swift song is actually one thats unrealeased called Diary of Me heres a link: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aYokv91NiM

From her newest album I really like "All you had to do was Stay" haha. 

Who is your favorite artist? where do you sing the most? For me its a tie between the car and shower, but i sincerely hope your answer is different xD 

I hope I didn't miss anything, let me know if i did  you have been expert in your responses and I'm trying to match you in that! haha. 

Cant wait to hear back from you! 

Taylor Swift "Diary Of Me" Lyrics unpitched

Wednesday 3:55pm

Oh my goodness!!!! Our messages are getting long! I copy and pasted your message into a word document and you wrote more than 1400 words!!!!!! WOW!!!!! That’s more than I write in an essay or in a lab report! And to think we do this one-two times a day!?!!!!  heheh And yes I am excited to see where our friendship goes, especially when we meet one another! 

I would call you, but my phones doesn’t get good reception, so I literally won’t understand you. Literally every other sentence I will be like What? What? What? WHAT???!?!??! And then I will lose connection and then I will forget what we are talking about or have no clue…this happens all the time when I call my mom. Hahah 
You would do whatever I’d like to see?!?!??!?!?! WOW this is great!!  Are you sure you mean that!?! Ahaha I am only kidding I won’t make you do anything awful…..Im not that kind of person. Honestly you I would make you show me Cassiopeia and I will probably make you buy me ice cream! I am simple, I mean I don’t want to scare you with ridiculous requests! 

OMG YOU ARE A FANTASTIC PIANO PLAYER!!!! YOU WERE AMAZING IN BOTH VIDEOS!!!!!! THAT WAS SOOO GOOD!!!!! I don’t know what you are talking about that was incredible!!!! Are you kidding me? It was a great idea for you to tell me to look at these videos! Because now I can tell you how AMAZING YOU ARE!!!!  heheh maybe I’ll send you videos of me singing…we’ll see. I like how you played a Taylor Swift song…very nice and your aunt has a beautiful voice!!!!!  

I love learning about you too!!! I love reading your messages over and over again! I just hope you don’t find me too crazy!!! Although you probably do haha. And I don’t expect you to tell me everything; if you told me everything then what would we talk about? You keep me in suspense for your next message!  And I like that!!! But I am glad that you are able to open up to me and tell me things about you! I guess over time we’ll have to see where our relationship takes us. 

I like how you apply what you learn! Very smart! And I am glad that I am not a problem in your life…at least not yet.   

If we met up, I would probably be nervous and shy at first, but it’s not because I would feel uncomfortable around you. It is just when I meet people in person for the first time, I have anxiety because I want to make a good first impression and I kind of forget who I am sometimes, which sounds weird. But sometimes I am good at hiding my nerves, but other times it is written all over my face of how nervous I am. But if we met, my nerves will probably go away quickly, but sometimes it takes me a little longer to get over being shy (not always). But in all honestly I am slightly different with each person I meet. Like I said, my friends don’t think  I am shy at all because with them I have no filter, and I am very loud and they can hear me talk and laugh from their rooms with the door closed. If my friends don’t hear me or my roomie laughing or talking, they worry about us and think something is wrong. I am writing this and it seems that I have two personalities! I hope you like both my shy and outgoing personalities! 

And that’s good that you got over your social anxiety! I am still working on that, but hopefully I will get over it soon. With these career events, is this like a way for you to get an internship? 

You would trust me in an airplane? Seriously? I haven’t been on an airplane in over 10 years and you would trust me? Well I mean as long as you don’t put me in control because I would have no idea what I am doing. And you trust me to drive? I guess I should tell you that for the longest time I had a fear of driving because I was afraid of getting in an accident and I lacked confidence. I was forced to get my license, but I didn’t do much driving after I got it. But now I am better and I am not that afraid anymore. I guess what got me over that fear is that I want to live with my best friend in her house next year, so I wanted to prove to my parents that I can drive. And plus I was tired of being dependent. I like doing things on my own and I didn’t want to be dependent anymore. I am not a terrible driver, but I could be better. But I am glad that you said that you trust me because trust is important in a relationship. So are you better at driving a car or flying an airplane? 

Hahaha I am glad that you understand how I trust you more than a roller coaster because if you didn’t then I would start to worry.  And thank you for wanting me to have happy memories!!!!  I want to have happy memories with you too!!!! And in all honesty whether we went to an amusement park or a hike, we would find a way to have tons of fun!  

And yes you are a very unique person who has caught my eye!!!  And no my feet do not smell like roses…I was just kidding. I don’t think anyone’s feet can smell like roses. And no worries, it can be hard to pick up sarcasm, since you can’t hear my tone. But I am not that much of a sarcastic person, just so you know. And yeah my pointe shoes get what they deserve….but then I need to buy new ones. 

And you’re welcome!!!!!  AWwwwww John thanks!     hahaha but I don’t really want to turn this into a competition of who has the biggest heart.

Wow! That is an amazing story of how you overcame your fear. It must have been the best feeling in the world once you did it! That is such an accomplishment and I bet you will never forget that! You must have been prepared well, even if you were scared. And I am glad that it wasn’t a life or death situation!

YAY!!!!!! I CAN’T WAIT TO DANCE EITH YOU!!!!!  and I don’t care if you are not a good dancer, as long as we have fun that’s all I care about!!  We can dance to all kinds of music, if it is just the two of us. Otherwise at parties it is mostly rap or electronic music…so be prepared for anything!!! 

I am glad that I am not the only one who has trouble swallowing pills! Hahah What I mean by fear of disappointing people, I mean not meeting their expectations. I am from a small town and basically everyone knew my family and I have three older brothers so basically all the teachers I had already knew me because they had my brothers. I was afraid of disappointing my teachers and I was afraid of being compared to my brothers since they were all very smart so I always felt like I either had to be just as good or better in order to meet expectations. And also, a lot of people were friends with my brothers, so sometimes I thought they only liked me because of my brothers since they were all very outgoing/well-known, not that I wasn’t. I was just different from them, but sometimes I felt like I had to live up to their expectations in order for those people to like me. But in all honesty, I quickly got over that in high school. And this fear also applies to jobs as well, I am afraid of not meeting the employer’s expectations, but all I can do is try. 

Hahah I should probably overcome that fear of swallowing pills, but I am not as bad as you…I can swallow the tiny ones just fine. Or maybe I will find a different way of compounding certain medication so that the pills are smaller and easier to swallow without taking like 10 of them. I have 4 more years to overcome that fear. By the way pharmacy is a 6 year program so I have many more years of school to go.  but hopefully it will be worth it! I think you said you were studying computer engineering, right? What do you want to do with that degree? 

OH NOOOO!!!! I will choose the roller coaster. I feel like you would choose the scariest roller coaster just to see me freak out! And I should probably face me fear so that it no longer bothers me, but we’ll see if I ever get over it! 

All of that flying stuff sounds so complicated with planning it and figuring out how long it will take you. Is it easy to get lost? But it sounds so cool!  You sound like a pro, which makes me trust you even more with flying because I am sooo bad with directions and navigating! And I love hearing about you flying experience because it sounds soo interesting and fun!!!! I don’t fly that much, so for me I love hearing about it…especially from an expert like you!!!  And I don’t have really any big adventures. I live a pretty basic life, unlike you who has been on soo many adventures. I mean over the summer, my family and I went on a vacation to the Adirondacks and we hiked up this mountain and my dad almost fell off the mountain, which is funny now since he was ok, haha But anyways I can’t really think of any big adventures in my life at the moment. 

AND I DID HAVE AN AMAZING DAY YESTERDAY SIR JOHN!!!!!  And I don’t really like the nickname Beth. I prefer Liz, Lizzie (or however you want to spell it), or Elizabeth. Ummmm I didn’t do anything much. I went to the doctors for my yearly check-up and good news……I am a healthy girl!!! And I watched a little tv, and mostly work. I have a lot of work to do this break. My classes are picking up since I had a lot of snow days and I have been slacking a little in my classes…ooops. Hahah don’t worry I am doing fine. But yeah I am going shopping tomorrow and hopefully on Friday I will see my friends! But other than that I did enjoy my day…mainly because I got to talk to you!!!!  

By the way I really like the song “Diary of Me” by Taylor Swift…it is SOOOOOOO GOOD!!!! I will probably listen to it again after I finish typing this!  
I don’t have a favorite artist. If a song catches my interest, I will listen to it and love it. I listen to songs for different reasons. Some of them I listen to just to listen to, some of them I listen to in order to learn how to sing it, and some songs I listen to just to dance to. 

But I guess you can say that I really like ONE DIRECTION!!!!! Hahah don’t worry I am not obsessed with them, I just really like their songs. My favorite songs by them are “Don’t Forget Where You Belong” and “Change Your Ticket” 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml6robC9y44  Don’t Forget Where You Belong

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5rnsL9vdE8  Change Your Ticket

My favorite song by Taylor Swift is “Love Story” and probably forever will be. 
Hahahah I mostly sing in the shower. At home my mom says that she can hear me from across the street….how embarrassing. And at school sometimes my friends leave their doors open so that they can hear me sing, but they can still hear me with the door closed. Hahahah Sometimes when I pace around my house I sing or if I am in my room. 

Honestly if you had missed something I wouldn’t notice because there is sooooo much to talk about and to respond to! Haha Don’t worry about it!! 

I am sorry it took me soo long to respond. This took me like 2 hours to write!!! Hahah Wow and it is over 2000 words. 

I hope you enjoy your day!!! And enjoy responding to this long ass message!!!

Wednesday 8:02pm
ya these messages sure are getting long haha. Thats alright though! I dont mind writing an essay as personal as this one if you're its audience  

Thats a bummer about your phones reception, i'm looking forward to hearing your voice when we meet, especially when you sing  between texting and this though we do get a lot of talking together in one day though which is awesome. and LOL I'm sure I mean that you  could ask me for anything and I'd oblige xD at this point theres nothing to hide haha. Showing you Cassiopeia would be a lot of  fun though, as would ice cream  have you ever been to lickey splits? Hmm actually theres a really nice place in bristol/warren that sells amazing cabinets, and not the kitchen kind  if I can request a picture of your shoes you could most definitely make a rediculous request as well! 

Thanks for the compliments  I tried searching on your profile for videos of you singing or dancing but couldn't find any :< idk if its because they aernt there, or if its because im bad at facebook stalking. You should TOTALLY send me videos of you singing though, I would love that  

Honestly I would never find you too crazy, you're awesome and we click really well together haha I bet that anyone who read our messages would think that we are both nuts but hey haters gonna hate  right? xD If I told you everything we would still find things to talk about, and same if you told me everything; one topic leads right into another with us  and ohhhhh you used the word relationship, I like that. I know you mean friendship but its still a big word haha. 

I would never call you a problem in my life! but if we are going to use that terminology, can we please become problems in each others lives? or maybe we should call it a solution since that word is fluffier and better sounding lol. 

I might be a bit awkward too when we first meet up but i have a good feeling that both of us will get over that immediately and become comfy with each other fast(: if you think about it, we've both already made good first impressions since obviously we like each other and are still talking  to be completely honest, I think its cute that you'd be shy at first i know you aernt shy talking to me right now. Maybe after we first meet up, when we get home we will text each other about how weird we are xD haha.

I'd say I still have some social anxiety but the career events did help. And yup! they are how I best go about getting co-op's and internships. An internship is working over the summer, and a co-op is taking a semester off of school to work for a company. 

And I guess I say I'd trust you in an airplane but thats kind of cheating since I could just take over again. I haven't flown in a year now though, last time I flew was spring break because its pretty expensive to rent an airplane. My uncle always tell me that flying solves all your financial problems by making you never have any money  before I fly again I'd have to spend an hour or so with an instructor to refresh and reaquiant myself with flying. Legally I'd only need to do one solo flight with 5 landings and takeoffs to take passengers, but when I'm rusty I'd rather go up with an instructor first which isn't a big deal at all. I never knew you had anxiety when it comes to driving, to me that always came naturally! I grew up on a small farm when I was little though and got to drive around very crappy trucks as a teen so that helped me once I got my actual driving license. What kind of car do you drive? I really like that you want to be independent, it makes me think of you as someone who is more responsible(: and I'd say I'm better at driving than at flying but I drive a lot more than fly. The drive from college to home is ~640 miles one way.

Lol if I ever start to make you worry about something please bring it up! or just throw something at me, that would work too. jk dont do that xD I hope I've caught more than just your eye, I was hoping I'd also at least catch your nose too because then I could tease you with it. 

Oh and I suppose if you sprayed your feet with perfume then they might smell rose like, but that  would be a waste of perfume haha because who is ever going to sniff your feet? xD maybe if you were being cruel to me you'd stick them in my face, eeek I better be careful, i probably dont wanna know what they smell like T.T I can be sarcastic sometimes but you'll definitely know when I am, and a lot of my jokes can be very corny lol 

Awhh probably the only part of this I dislike/regret was how I worded my response to you saying I have a big heart. I hope you never feel as though we are competing, like ever. I apologize for that  I try my hardest to not judge other people, we should all do what we are happiest doing. Some of the people I'm closest friends too aern't going to college, but they are happy and others judge them for their decision to not go when it isn't their place to. Also, you  can't judge a book based on its cover, and people aern't like books. You'll never read everything about them so really its bad to judge and I always try to avoid that but sometimes I slip up, like I did here. Sorry! 

On a happier note, I can't wait to dance with you too! Although I have a feeling its going to be something like you dragging me around across the dance floor and me trying my best to keep up haha. I really am a bad dancer, so I hope you know what you're getting yourself into! lol you say be prepared for anything but really theres no preparing I can do  

I completely understand where you're coming from in terms of not disappointing anyone. You mustve felt like you were under a lot of pressure to do well when you were growing up. I'm glad you're over it now for the most part. But did that influence your decision to seek a degree in pharmacy..? I'm curious now how you got interested in that  

Its a good thing you aern't as bad as me at swallowing pills, I bet you'll get over it much faster than I will haha. Luckily being a pharmacists doesn't mean you need to actually be able to swallow pills or you'd be in trouble  Pharmacy is a very long program but it will be worth it at the end. Whenever I have to go to the pharmacy I think about all the trouble the pharmacists had to go through and all the info they know about the different medication they are responsible for knowing about. I always feel a little bit bad because I know that at somepoint they will need to deal with people who have no respect for them and honestly they did a ton of work to get to where they were. I plan to do either software or hardware design (engineers prefer the word engineering over design though) for a company that works with technology related to space. Right now I'm leaning more towards software, but thats the beauty of my degree. Unlike electrical engineers or computer science majors I get to learn about both hardware and software, not one or the other. The downside being that I don't know as much higher level software stuff as the computer science majors. When I was in highschool I took a class in computer repair, it was a 3 year course. By the time I finished it in my senior year I realized how much I actually disliked fixing peoples computers/devices but also that I still loved technology and wanted to be the one helping to develop it.

Flying isn't complicated at all really, its just a LOT of little things to remember, but they are all little. It can be easy to get lost, there are certain bad things you look for that can be life threatening but are very easily avoidable. The worst of them is clouds, for a pilot like me, I can't fly in clouds, it could be very very bad and certainly illegal. If you do get lost, you can't stop, or pull over. But theres a procedure for everything. If I got lost, well what you're supposed to do is fly the plane first, the plane always gets first priority. Once the plane is all set, if I was totally lost with no hope of finding my way I'd ask for help on the radio. Oh and flying commercially really isn't as fun as an experience, as almost any person would tell you haha. But in a small plane it can be very fun  what was the Adirondacks like?? Was there a lot of cool stuff to see there? It sounds a bit dangerous if you can fall off a mountain, I actually never thought that could happen, I kind of think you would just gently roll off of it lol. Life itself is a big adventure, and I'm glad we met because now we can be a part of each others adventures!

I'm glad you had a great day yesterday and I'll be sure to avoid calling you Beth. Although we could probably think of better pet names for each other aside from Queen Elizabeth and Sir John haha. I'm glad you've got a clean bill of health! Thats always great news! What kind of classes do you have right now? Dont worry about slacking a little, everyone does it haha I'm bad with it too. 

What are you going shopping for? Sounds like a fun day  tomorrow is my busy day but I'll try to text you and keep in touch  I'm glad you'll be with your friends since that way we will both be distracted. 

I'm glad you liked the T-Swift song  I listened to the two one direction songs you posted and they were good as well, although I still like some of their original or hit songs like "What makes you Beautiful" and "One Thing" I used to jam out to that a lot, embarrassingly haha. Once we are together, if we are driving somewhere or are alone I'd totally jam out with you to one direction!!

Oh and I talked to my friends about Frozen today. Actually, it was THE WEIRDEST conversation ever. I went to 5 guys with four of my friends from Stats class and I brought up the topic of frozen and they all watched it and said they liked it, but we later agreed that if anyone asked just one of us, we would say we were pressured into watching it xD it was very silly. Then the weird part was after we talked about cool thinking problems like problems that you need to think about in a weird way to arrive at the correct answer. 

 Its a good thing that you like "Love Story" the most by taylor swift, its a very easy piano song, the second song I ever learned on piano actually lol we will most definitely be doing a duet at some point  

Lol the fact that your friends leave their doors open when you sing means you have a beautiful voice  if I did that, my friends would probably throw something at me haha. 

Dont be sorry for taking a while to respond, yours is a long and beautiful message.  In a way though I have an advantage, because of my major I have a fast typing speed, around 90wpm on the high end but typically 80 wpm, feel free to call me a dork at any point you'd like. It was indeed fun responding to you "long ass message"  i hope you enjoy mine and I look forward to getting to text you for the rest of the night!   

beware, no proof reading in this message! O.O

I will respond to everything tomorrow, but I just need to tell you that I was not at all offended by the paragraph about me/you having big hearts! Please don't worry about that! I actually meant that I didn't want us going back and fourth in saying "you have the biggest heart" "no you have the biggest heart" and trying to prove that the other has the biggest heart. I should have worded that differently. You have nothing to be sorry about and I didn't mean to scare you! And I agree with you, I try not to judge people either. I try to accept people for who they are. 

I hope you have a great night and I will probably text you until I go to bed! 

Like I said I will respond to everything tomorrow! But thank you for this beautiful and touching response. I can tell you put your heart and soul into it! 
Thanks for clearing things up  I look forward to texting you and like you always tell me, no rush on responding!
Friday 1:13am

Let’s shoot for 3000 words!! Hahah jk I don’t think I have written anything that long before. You write a bestseller every time.   Just thought you should know! 
Haha I feel like I say more to you than to anyone else I have been talking to lately. I can’t wait to hear your voice so that when I read your messages, it would be like you are telling me. I have to make up a voice when I read your messages.

I am glad that you will try to do anything I ask, but all I still want is to see Cassiopeia, ice cream, and I am adding watching a movie so that we can cuddle. I am simple. The rest I want to be a surprise, which means you are going to have to plan and work!!!!  And no I have never been to Lickey Splits. And when you say cabinets do you mean milkshakes? I feel like I am such a bad Rhode Islander for not really knowing what you mean by cabinet. Hahah  I don’t care where we go for ice cream just as long as if there is ice cream!  And the ridiculous requests come later….much later. 

The reason why you can’t find any pictures of me singing is because there are none on my facebook. I have a bunch of videos saved on my computer, but every time I try to download them onto our message, it says that the file is too big.  I haven’t figured out how to download it yet to this message, but I will figure out something, so it might take me a while before I post a video of me singing. I tried sending you this video of me and my siblings singing, but you would not be able to see it because it came from my dad’s profile and only his friends can watch it. But anyways I am trying!!!!! I am just sooo technologically challenged!!! 

Awwww THANKS JOHN!!!!!!  Yeah people would probably think we are nuts, but they would probably go “AWWWWWWWW HOW CUTE” too. Heheh The only reason why people would hate us is because they would be jealous of our conversation and wish they had someone to talk to. I am glad that we can just keep on talking and talking and talking and talking…..nothing will ever be boring. And yes I used the term relationship, a term I only use when I talk about people who are special to me.  

Ummmm I don’t think it would be a good idea if we became problems in each others lives because it makes me think that I am a pest ahahah I mean I can be sometimes….at least to my siblings and hopefully not with you! LOL We can be a solution…that sounds better like you said or we can be an equation: You + Me = US  hahaah IDK we can play around with the equation. 

And you’re right, when we first meet it will probably be a bit awkward at first because it is our first time seeing each other in person…no more hiding behind the computer screen. But we will push past that quickly because there is a special connection between us and we just click, like you said. And just so you know, I will not next you how weird we are, I will text you how AWESOME we are!  

Ohhh ok I have always wondered the difference between a co-op and an internship…thank you for clearing that up!  Are you required to do both an internship and a co-op? Just curious what year are you at school? 

Hahaha so you don’t really trust me in an airplane anymore! Haha And your uncle is funny! And you need to do what’s right for you when it comes to becoming comfortable flying again! And I am not as scared about driving anymore, since I do it more often now and I am becoming more comfortable. I drive either this oldish Neon we have or a 2009 corolla (I think those are the names of the cars…I am really bad with car names). Wow you grew up on a farm?!?!?! THAT IS SOOO COOL!!! What kind of farm was it? And that’s cool that you got to drive those old must have been fun! Did you used to brag about driving the truck as a teenager? Your college is a 640 mile drive?!?! HOLY SHIT!!! That is a loooonnngggg way from home!!!! I mean I knew it was a long way, but I can’t get over that you are that far away! 

HAha trust me I will let you know if I ever get anxiety. But just soo you know, I am not really an anxious person. I hardly ever really have anxiety! For the most part I am chill and very relaxed and just happy. I don’t really get nervous on a normal/average day.  I mean if I were to throw something at you, I would miss because I don’t think I can throw anything close to 640 miles.  hehehe And even if you were in front of me, I would still miss. OMG you mean you have my nose!?!?!? I have been looking for it and you have had it this whole time!?!?!? GIVE IT BACK!!!!  heheheh 

I mean perfume was invented to cover the bad odor, so it wouldn’t be a waste if I sprayed some on my feet if it meant that you wouldn’t make fun of me for how bad they smell! I would only stick my feet in your face if you deserved it, but you should be happy that they are in your face since you are just dying to see them!  hehehe And plus if my feet are in your face, I can’t run away, so I am vulnerable. AND I LOVE YOUR VERY CORNY JOKES!!!!!!! The paragraph about you catching my nose and this paragraph made me laugh soo much!!!! I cried a little….you know tears of joy! :’D

Hahah like I said, I don’t care if you are a bad dancer, I just want to have fun dancing with you. I know the guy is supposed to lead, but I may have to lead if we dance.  
In all honestly URI was the only pharmacy school I applied to, and I was forced by my parents to apply to URI and to the pharmacy program there. I didn’t want to go to URI because it was in RI. I originally wanted to do pre-med, so I applied to a lot of schools that had pre-med programs. But in all honesty I was interested in any profession in the medical field. I chose URI pharmacy because I really liked the program once I learned about it on acceptance student’s day. It is a 0-6 year program meaning that once I got in, I was in. I don’t have to compete for a spot for pharmacy school (which starts my junior year) and I don’t have to take the pcat. I just need to maintain at least a 2.5GPA and pass the interview( which was super easy) and write an essay( which was also super easy). Other pharmacy schools you have to compete for a spot and you have to take the pcat, but thankfully URI does not do that….I would probably die!!! 

And thank you for what you said about pharmacists. I hear some awful stories from my friends who work at the pharmacy about customers being impatient or complaining that the flu shots given at the pharmacy are contaminated. But I am not going to lie, some of the rules at the pharmacy are a bit weird. MY friend who is a pharm tech, he told me that every time a patient comes to pick up a prescription, he has to tell them it will take 15 minutes, even if he knows it will take more or less time. There was one time he told a patient that her prescription would take 30 minutes (since he knew it would take that long) and the pharmacist yelled at him, even though it took 30 minutes….I don’t understand. 

I have a question, what is the difference between software and hardware? And that is very fitting that you want to do work for technology related to space!  It’s a good thing you took that class in high school; it put you in the right direction.   So if I ever had a problem with my computer, I could ask you how to fix it? 

You seem to know what you are doing when you fly, even if there are a bunch of little things to remember. You are a PRO!!!!!!!  I am confused, what do you mean by flying commercially? I am sorry that is probably something obvious that I am not understanding. 

The Adirondacks is just a beautiful mountain chain in upstate New York. I mean there are lots of mountains to look at. You can go white water rafting. You can visit the Olympic center up at Lake Placid, since the Olympics were held there twice. There are a lot of trails to go on, so you will never be bored. Lake George is a very touristy place up in the Adirondacks; you can go parasailing on lake George. It is just very open up in the Adirondacks; it is breathtaking sometimes. 

And well, my dad technically didn’t fall off the mountain; he fell off this ledge. It was raining that day, so the trail was very slippery. The funny part was he was like “Children go on the dirt path; don’t go on the rocks”. And what was he doing….walking on the rocks and he slipped, but he was ok…he was actually laughing as it happened. But my sister didn’t know that he was laughing so when she saw him fall, she thought he was hurt really bad, so she was balling her eyes out, but I calmed her down. I am just glad he was ok!  

Awwwwwww I CAN’T WAIT UNTIL WE GO ON AN ADVENTURE TOGETHER!!!!!! May couldn’t come soon enough!!!!!!

Today (or should I say yesterday) I went shopping for clothing, shoes, and make-up. I’ll tell you where you went, but I doubt you know what any of these stores are because I wouldn’t expect you to shop in any of these stores. I went to DSW and bought some shoes, I went to Sephora to buy my make-up, and then I went to forever 21, H&M, and Charlotte Russe to shop for clothes. I went with my mom and then I got my hair trimmed…..my dad or my brothers didn’t even notice. And then I went to my grandparents’ house, which is something I do every Thursday evening when I am home. I’ll see my friends tomorrow which I am excited for! 

Ummmmm I can’t think of other pet names for you or me at the moment, but I don’t know if anything can top Queen Elizabeth or Sir John…..those just top the charts!  
This semester I am taking Biochem, Biostatistics, Orgo (organic Chemistry) lab, and this honors class where I learn about how children and adolescence cope with loss and the grieving process children go through so basically this is considered a death class. And believe it or not, this Death class is my favorite class! What classes are you taking? 

By the way…I LOVED THE SONG “THE STORY OF US!!!!!”  Thank you for sharing!!!!! I have never heard of the song until now!

OMG YOU LIKE ONE DIRECTION!!?!?!?!??! I AM BEYOND HAPPY RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!  YES WE HAVE TO JAM OUT TO ONE DIRECTION!!!!!!!! THAT IS A MUST!!!!!! AHHHHHH I AM SOO EXCITED TO DO THAT!!!!!  

Hahahah 5 guys go to 5 guys….very fitting!  AWWWWWW What a bunch of cuties!!!!! That is sooo cute how you brought up Frozen….I am soo proud of you!! Heeheh of course you guys would say that you were forced…you just don’t want to admit that you secretly had this burning desire to watch it, and you needed a reason to watch it!  So you went from talking about frozen to cool thinking problems…interesting. I don’t see how either topic relates to one another. How can you think about problems in a weird way? Actually don’t answer that because I don’t think I’ll understand. 

ANd I would never call you a dork, because that never comes to my mind. To me you are just an amazing person who can always bring a smile to my face.  

Awwwww Thanks John!!!!  WOW! You type fast!!! I am lucky if I type like 40wpm; I think too much when I type. 

Your message brought me great joy when I read it and I had a blast responding to it!!! This is sooo much fun!!!!  

I hope you had a wonderful day full of happiness and sunshine and laughter and unicorns!  

Have a wonderful Night!!!!
Friday 6:42pm
Are we shooting for 3k words? You do know that there is a limit to how much text we can enter in this chat right?:P We shouldn't come close to reaching it I think/hope xD You write good novels too, I think we could probably drop out at this point and go into the business of book writing (; Guess what, I got to hear your voice! I can apply it your messages when I read them haha. But I will let you hear my voice after I send this. Maybe I'll voice it over using Morgan Freemans voice.. just kidding XD I am curious about something though, the voice that you made up, whats it sound like? haha

Cassiopeia, ice cream, and a movie? Gosh, you're soo needy! Just kidding, I cant wait  I'll try to think of some surprises but dont those usually wait until the second date?:P When I said cabinets, I meant milkshakes of course. Rhode Island is "famous" for them, but I guess not many people in rhode island actually go to get them? Maybe its being phased out. When you say ridiculous requests, what do you actually have on your mind? 

Oh and speaking of your singing videos/pictures, the ones you sent were perfect  you have such a cute and beautiful voice, and also it was adorable when you played with your hair a little during one of the songs  

Lol my friend looked over my shoulder earlier today in class and saw that I was reading one of our facebook messages (he didnt read anything) and he was like "uh oh". He thought we were in an argument xD I was like, nope, quite the opposite. And he was jelly:P so you are very right and honestly, I'd be jealous of our conversations too if I wasn't having them, they are awesome and I feel special to be able to know and get close to someone as amazing as yourself. Thanks for breaking the ice on the term relationship, I was actually thinking of using it in a prior message but was too shy/hesistant. You are right though, it should only be used for people who are special in your life. You're special to me too :') 

If you tried to be a pest I think I'd just find it cute haha. Remember the rock throwing conversation we had? xD It takes quite a lot to annoy or upset me, I'm a very easy going person and brush off most things (which is good and bad). When I'm angry or upset I get really quiet. What do you do? 
I think modeling our relationship with an equation is a bit too complex, but nice try with the You + Me = US  if you watched star trek, I would say that that is something Mr. Spock would do (he is very very logical). 

I dont think it will be terribly awkward when we first meet but youre right (I've said that a lot this conversation haven't I? xD ) we click really well with one another! 

At my school you aern't required to do anything if you dont want to. But my goal when I graduate is to eventually work for SpaceX or another company in the space industry. So part of me reaching my goal is to intern and co-op so I can get a bullet proof resume. But its not all about the work experience, I also try to do a crap load of after school projects because thats another thing companies look for, they want to see passion in your work. 

I trust you! If I had a big button that hit me everytime it was pressed I'd give it to you just to prove to you that I trust you  thats saying a lot! I think :S hahaha. I'm SO glad you're not afraid to drive, I thought I was gonna have to go ALL THE WAY to cumberland to pick you up! gosh, thats like a huge 30 minute drive, I'd need to pack a lunch and everythin- JUST KIDDING lol but tell me thats not a typical rhode island response?? I'm bad with cars too, so no worries... my friends bug be about it all the time haha. And oh I didn't live on a farm farm when I grew up, it was very tiny. We have/had one cow for beef, 10 or so chickens for eggs/meat, a pig during the summer for a pig roast party, a very small flock of turkeys (like 3) because they need buddies or they get sad (we were originally going to eat them but they are VERY VERY friendly animals and we couldnt do it). And 2 small gardens that provided enough food to probably last a year, but because we didn't  can any of the food, we only enjoyed it for a few months. The animals we had varied a lot, at one point we had 3 sheep as pets. Right now we have 1 cow, ~10 chickens, and 3 goats (pets) so its very small but enough to keep a family occupied:P 

When I was a teenager I didn't brag about driving the trucks, no lol. I've never been a fan of trucks actually, I just kinda dont like them. The 640 mile drive makes any other driving I have to do seem minimal, so its always fun going back to rhode island and hearing my family bicker about a 10 minute drive to the super market  But hey if you ever wanna visit, the area is beautiful with plenty of cool things to see! xD 

I cant wait to meet you and see what you're like on an "average" day haha. you do seem relaxed, happy and like someone who sees the positives in situations. You'd have to have a really good arm to throw something at me from 640 miles, and sorry if this seems like I'm randomly jumping to different topics, I'm trying to hit all your questions haha! Sorry but I'm gonna have to hold onto your nose until it can be returned in person!  

Hmm you have a good point about perfume covering bad odor, but at the same time, I think if you sprayed it on your feet it would still smell bad because it would just mix with the smell thats already there  I'm glad that you'd only stick your feet in my face if I deserved it, I take it to mean that I'm invincible and will never ever deserve such a fate as that right?? xD I think I'd be conflicted if I saw them that way, you're right Id get to see them but depending on the day and how much walking/dancing you did I think i'd regret it lol! But since like you said you'd be vulnerable, I take it to mean that you're very ticklish? If your feet are in my face idc how stinky they are, you will be getting tickled, mercilessly! 

I wish I had been keeping better track of how many of my corny jokes you laughed at so far and how many went over your head lol. I bet I'd have a pretty average score, like a 72 or a 73 maybe. 

When we dance (keyword = when) would you mind if you had to lead? I know it wouldn't be a test of skill at all, it would just be us having a lot of fun being in each others company  

Did your parents not allow you to do pre-med out of state? You're right about the brightside of that though, its non competitive so now that you're in you can just focus on your school work. Will you do any internships at pharmacies when you're able to? 
If when you do graduate you aernt happy working at a pharmacy, what  other options have you got available? Why do they have that rule about waiting for a prescription even if it takes more/less time? That is kinda odd. 

You might wanna be careful asking me computer questions, I have the potential to put you to sleep here! XD Hardware is the physical components, the stuff you would see if you ripped into your computer and looked inside. Its a bit more than that though, because some of the stuff you can see (the big black chips with metal arms coming out) have circuits inside of them which is what I'd be designing. Software is the stuff that "runs" on the hardware, so like when you run a program such as your web browser, of however you are reading this message, it is executing software that is running on top of the hardware  the two go hand and hand and both have their interesting/boring points. And yes, if you ever have an issue thats electrical or computer related I could help you with it :> Is that to say, I can ask you medical stuff when I'm feeling gloomy..? Cause if so, no more web MD for me! hahaha. 

Sorry for the confusion! When I say fly commercially what I mean is if you were to buy a plane ticket and get flown somewhere else by a big airliner. That kind of flying is boring and tedious haha. In a small plane though you can see and feel more; and also go wherever you want  

You went white water rafting!?!?!? What did you think of it? The Aidirondacks sounds like a great place for a vacation  did you visit the olympic center? If so, what could you do there? Oh and what is parasailing? Sorry if thats something I should know by now  did you do it?

Im glad your dad was ok, it sounds like he was like "do as I say not as I do" lol! 

Time actually flies, May will be here before you know it! Sounds like a fun day for you yesterday. I probably would've noticed the haircut if I knew you  unless you literally only got one hait cut. You're right about me not knowing any of the stores haha. I do know forever 21 though, I have some friends and cousins who love that store so it makes for a great place to get birthday present gift cards  What kind of cloths and shoes did you get? Lets see if I can recognize anything  do your grandparents have awesome cooking? Whenever someone talks about grandparents food comes to my mind because my grandma always cooks up a storm. 

And Queen Elizabeth and Sir John it is then! Although I do hope that at some point in life you will decide to Knight me (; 

AND     those classes all sound wicked hard!! Especially organic chemistry. And a death class...? that one sounds the most interesting to me. Lol I thought that before I read the part where you said it was your favorite. Also, whats Biostatisics? 

I'm a Junior, my program is only 4 years of college but I will go to college for 5 years since next semester I will be co-oping instead of taking courses (or what I like to call colleging). This semester I have, argicultural arts and society (A bullshit class I need to take relating agriculture to art, its pretty fun though), digital design 2, electronics lab, probability and statistics, applied software design, computer organization and architecture, and global ethics (philosophy course).

I'm glad we have such similar taste in music  I CANT WAIT TO JAM OUT WITH YOU  I have a subwoofer in my car (its not that powerful) and my friends always make fun of me because like I use it to listen to taylor swift and pop/light rock music haha. When we get together, we can totally jam out to one direction on the first date!  

I thought you'd be happy that I brought up frozen lol with the group of guys I hang out with, no ones shy to admit what they enjoy. And I'm not ashamed to admit that I have a desire (not burning though) to see the second frozen. And yes, we went from talking about Frozen to thinking problems. They really aern't as bad as you think! You could definitely understand them. We talk about them a lot because at the interviews we go to, companies like to sometimes ask them. They look for people who think outside the box about problems which is something anyone can do if they practice that.  Here try this one out:

You have a big wall. On one side of the wall is 3 light switches (you are standing on this side). On the other side of the wall, there is 3 lightbulbs. You can't see the lightbulbs from where you are with the switches. You are allowed to go from the switch side of the wall, to the light bulb side of the wall, and then come back to the switch side of the wall. The light switches are randomly wired to the light bulbs such that there is one switch per bulb in a random order. The goal is to figure out which switch goes to which lightbulb. So for example, if you switched one light on and went and looked at the light bulbs you  would know that that switch went to that lightbulb, but you wouldnt know what lights go to the other 2 switches. Same if you left one off and the others on. Heres a picture of it: 

     (b)                      (b)                    (b)
---------------------WALL-----------------------------------------------
     (switch1)            (switch2)      (switch3)    you


So how do you figure out forsure which switch goes to which lightbulb? Remember, you can only go to the lightbulb side once after you do something with the switches and then come back, and no you cant see around the wall.  

I'm so happy I make you smile  I hope I can keep doing that, but I have a feeeling that after seeing that problem maybe you'll get frustrated lol. Or maybe you'll get it right away! 

Thanks so much for your last message, it was so beautiful and fun to read  no rush on responding, just enjoy your friday and have a wonderful night!
oh you might enjoy this lol
